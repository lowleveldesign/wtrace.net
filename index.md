## Hello fellow troubleshooters!

A few years ago, I released wtrace, a command-line tool to collect system traces. Thanks to simplicity and ease-of-use, it gained some popularity in the developers’ community. I plan to publish more tools like it: easy-to-use but insightful at the same time. This page will be their home.
